### **What is `useContext` in React.js?**
`useContext` is a built-in React Hook that allows you to access and share values between components without passing props manually at every level.

---

## **Why Was `useContext` Introduced?**
Before `useContext`, React applications relied heavily on **prop drilling** to pass data from a parent component to deeply nested child components. This approach became cumbersome and made code harder to maintain.

### **Does `useContext` Overcome Prop Drilling?**
Yes, `useContext` eliminates the need for **prop drilling** by allowing components to access the shared state directly from a **React Context** without passing props manually.

---

## **Example of Prop Drilling (Without `useContext`)**
### **Scenario:** Passing a user name from `App` (Parent) to `ProfileDetails` (Nested Child)

#### **Without `useContext` (Using Prop Drilling)**
```jsx
import React from "react";

const App = () => {
  const user = "John Doe"; // Data at top-level component

  return <Parent user={user} />;
};

const Parent = ({ user }) => {
  return <Child user={user} />;
};

const Child = ({ user }) => {
  return <ProfileDetails user={user} />;
};

const ProfileDetails = ({ user }) => {
  return <h2>User: {user}</h2>;
};

export default App;
```

### **Explanation:**
- The `user` prop is passed from `App` → `Parent` → `Child` → `ProfileDetails`.
- If more intermediate components were added, we would have to **manually pass** `user` through all of them, leading to **prop drilling**.

---

## **Same Example Using `useContext` (Avoiding Prop Drilling)**
### **Steps to Implement `useContext`**
1. **Create a Context** for storing user data.
2. **Provide Context** at a higher level in the component tree.
3. **Consume Context** in deeply nested components.

---

### **Example Using `useContext`**
```jsx
import React, { createContext, useContext } from "react";

// Step 1: Create Context
const UserContext = createContext();

const App = () => {
  const user = "John Doe";

  return (
    // Step 2: Provide Context
    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>
      <Parent />
    </UserContext.Provider>
  );
};

const Parent = () => {
  return <Child />;
};

const Child = () => {
  return <ProfileDetails />;
};

const ProfileDetails = () => {
  // Step 3: Consume Context
  const user = useContext(UserContext);
  return <h2>User: {user}</h2>;
};

export default App;
```

---

### **How `useContext` Solves Prop Drilling?**
| Feature | Prop Drilling | useContext |
|---------|--------------|------------|
| **Data Passing** | Passed manually via props | Accessed directly from context |
| **Scalability** | Becomes complex with more components | Easily manageable |
| **Code Readability** | Cluttered with repeated props | Clean and maintainable |

---

## **Final Thoughts**
- `useContext` is **best suited** for **avoiding prop drilling** in small to medium applications.
- For **larger applications with complex state**, Redux or React Query might be a better choice.
